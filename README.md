# ANN-for-image-classification
An Artificial Neural Network for image classification. The ANN classifies images of hand written numbers from the MINST dataset.

The file "minst.zip" contains a dataset of 42000 images represented as 28x28 pixel matrices. 

The file "ann.py" contains the code in python for the ANN from scratch. The artificial neural network uses backpropagation and correctly classifies images with around a 85% of accuracy.
